# sparta-dom-calculator

## Introduction

Following my previous javascript calculator this version reflects the learning I've done since. At heart it functions very similarly, lacking the advanced features. It, however, now interacts with the DOM allowing the introduction of a graphical interface.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your computer and run the calc.html file with your browser to bring up the DOM calculator. This calculator functions much like a standard basic calculator.
